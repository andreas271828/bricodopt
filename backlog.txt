- List codon frequencies (number, percent for amino acid [for both the input table and the result sequence])
  * Finished for input table
- Create proper comments and license information
- Write tests (e.g. compare amino acid sequences or original sequence and optimised sequence)
- Refactor (extract JavaScript, see FIX comments)
- Calculate optimal frequencies based on gene expression rates
- Access databases directly
- Design
