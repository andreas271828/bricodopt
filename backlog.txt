- Create proper comments and license information.
- Write tests (e.g. compare amino acid sequences or original sequence and optimised sequence).
- Refactor (extract JavaScript, see FIX comments).
- Calculate optimal frequencies based on gene expression rates.
- Improve optimisation algorithm (a probabilistic algorithm doesn't guarantee the best possible result).
- Access databases directly.
- Create design.
